          <p>The site “Plart” is developed mainly in the field of photography (photo shoots),
            which will include both professional photographers and novice photographers and, of course,
            site visitors (readers). It serves as a platform where photographers can publish their work,
            projects, photo collections, collaborate with readers, receive constructive evaluation and be
            inspired by the ideas of others. Readers, in turn, have the opportunity to communicate,
            collaborate with photographers, get inspired and evaluate their work.
            This is a platform with unlimited inspiration for you personally. So why not use it?
